# SmartShopAI - Grocery Price Comparison Platform
**Powered by AI, Perfected for Savings** | Version 0.1.1

## What is SmartShopAI?

SmartShopAI is a smart grocery price comparison platform built specifically for the Polish market. I created this tool to help people save money on their daily shopping by comparing prices across Poland's major retail chains in real-time.

Living in Poland, I noticed how much prices can vary between different stores for the same products. Sometimes you could save 20-30% just by shopping at the right place! That's why I built this platform - to make price comparison effortless and help families stretch their grocery budgets further.
